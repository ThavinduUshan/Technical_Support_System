# Technical Support System

We have developed this as a university project in our first year
for technical users to resolve their questions.
In this system, general questions that the users get will be
answered on a Frequently asked questions section. But if they
have a questions which not on the list. They can create an
account on the system and send a support ticket. Then the 
administrative user will review the questions and provide answers
for it.
